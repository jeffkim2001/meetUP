# meetUp
meetUp is a simple and practical social media iOS app that allows users to connect with other users with similar political beliefs. Because politics is a very sensitive topic to bring up in everyday conversations, the app allows users to expand their social impact by freely conversing about their opinions in a harmonious and safe chat environment. The app is divided into separate chatrooms based on political beliefs and users can discuss upcoming rallies, events, and/or opinions about various political events. The app was built in 7 hours at Tri-Valley Expo Hacks, a 180+ high school hackathon at Dublin, California.
